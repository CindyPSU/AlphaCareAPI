README FILE FOR REFACTORING NOTES

REFACTORING, BY CHRIS MORRIS:
1. Adding the status field to appointments
	- AppointmentStatus: A new enum that has the list of different statuses of appointments.
	- AppointmentHistory: Refactored to add an AppointmentStatus property to maintain the current status of an appointment.
	- AppointmentStoreStub: A new class that loads stubbed data on screen for testing.
	- DashboardFXMLController: Refactored to add appointment history data to the dashboard and loading stubbed data to show on screen.
2. Improve data input validation:
	- PatientInputException: Refactored by adding user-facing messages mapped from each of the error status codes.
	- PatientInputValidator: A new class that validates data inputs related to a patient.
	- PatientDetailFXMLController: Refactored to show an error message to the user when input is invalid.
3. Remove redundant patient classes:
	- Patient became PatientProfile. PatientProfile was then renamed to Patient. All of the renamed Patient’s properties were also renamed to remove the redundant naming “patient” that led each of the variable names; since they are properties inside of the Patient class, they do not need the prepending “patient,” that is inferred by their context. Finally, the User class changed its access modifiers to protected to allow Patient to access the properties when subclassing User.
4. Add an Address property to Patient:
	- Added an address property to Patient and replaced the implementations that were using a String object for the address with an Address instance.
5. Move digital signing to UserDigitalSigner
	- UserDigitalSigner: Added the signing functionality to UserDigitalSigner. The new static method takes a String argument, signs it, and returns an instance of UserDigitalSigner.
	- User: Removed the signing method all together.

REFACTORING AND 2ND USE CASE IMPLEMENTATION, BY CINDY HILGEMAN
1) **System Reports** - Simplify requirement to address new system usage by medical staff
Initially, several system reports were outlined in the requirements ascertained from stakeholders; however, to ensure appropriate and consistent system usage, stakeholders have agreed to begin with system usage reporting before proceeding with more complex reporting. (Refactoring of this component will be finalized in next dev phase due to the need to finalize the medical record interface noted in item 2 below.)

2) **Tabbed or Accordion View for Patient Medical Record Interface**
Given the non-definitive aesthetic preference for either design option, the development team will proceed with the most user-friendly and pragmatic design option. To make the final decision, the development team will implement both designs and then make the aesthetic selection for the interface.
*Design Notes:*
1. Patient Medical Record Interface Implemented with Accordion Control for the layout. The medical record contains seven (7) sections: Patient Information, Medical History, Immunization History, Prescription History, Appointment History, Vital Signs, and Test & Lab Results. 

**Use Case Implementation** View/Create Patient Medical Record
Rationale: The last development phase resulted in the creation of viewing patient details based on a patient search function. In this development phase we have implemented the complete patient medical record view (CompleteMedicalRecordFXML.fxml), and the functionality to create a new patient record. 

*Search/Update Patient Profile Use Case*
Usability Steps (Modified in this Dev Phase to utilized the Complete Medical Record View):
1. Run the AlphaCareAPI Application
2. Click on Login
3. Click on Patient Search
4. Select the patient row provided in the list view
5. The Complete Patient Medical Record will display and you can view the completed Patient Information section.
6. This information can be edited, saved (by clicking the save button at the bottom of the window), and will be stored in the Application database.

*View/Create Patient Medical Record Use Case*
Usability Steps:
1. Run the AlphaCareAPI Application
2. Click on Login
3. Click on Create New Patient
5. An empty Patient Medical Record will display and you can input and complete the Patient Information section.
6. Click Save and the new patient will be stored in the Application database.

REFACTORING IN TREATMENTMODEL BY KARIN MARTIN:

DISPENSABLES - UNNECESSARY CODE/LAZY CODE
1. Removed unused class DurableMedicalEquipment.java and references to it in Prescription.java. 
2. Removed unused class Referral.java and references to it in Prescription.java.
3. Removed unused class Therapy.java and references to it in Prescription.java.
4. Removed instance variables in Prescription.java associated with DurableMedicalEquipmentljava, Referral.java and Therapy.java classes: drugName, drugStrength, equipmentName, drugNotEquipment, instructions.

BLOATER - LARGE CLASS (TOO MANY INSTANCE VARIABLES)
1. Removed unnecessary pharmName, pharmAddress, and pharmPhone variables. Replaced with Pharmacy object. Removed all the getters/setters for these.
2. Moved manufacturer name variable to Drug.java class and deleted manufacturer location after researching that it isn't on most prescription labels. Deleted getters/setters. Added getters/setters for manufacturer in Drug.java class.
3. Deleted unnecessary pillMarkings variable (duplicate code) as it is already included in Drug.java class as "drugIdentification". Deleted getters/setters.
4. Deleted unnecessary instructions variable (duplicate code) as it is already included in Drug.java class as "drugInstructions". Deleted getters/setters. 
5. Deleted doctorName variable. Info can be pulled from user currently logged in. Deleted getters/setters.
6. Renamed rxIdentificationNbr to rXID to correspond with the variable being used in the Medical Record and changed it from long to int to match as well. Changed all the getters/setters to match.
7. Deleted unnecessary variable Date filled, as that information won't be known at the time the physician writes the prescription. Deleted getters/setters.
8. Renamed qtyFilled to quantity to make more sense to the process. Changed getters/setters to match.

BLOATER - LONG PARAMETER LIST
1. Removed unnecessary parameters that corresponded to items removed from Bloater - Large Class: pharmName, pharmAdd, pharmPhn, drugNm, drgStr, drgNotEquip, instructions, pillMarkings, manufacturer name and location.
2. Added Pharmacy object parameter to replace pharmacy name, address and phone number. Edited method to match updated list of parameters.

OBJECT-ORIENTATION ABUSER - SWITCH STATEMENT (IF/ELSE IN THIS CASE)
