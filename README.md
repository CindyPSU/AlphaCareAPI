README FILE FOR REFACTORING NOTES

Cindy - Items to Refactor
1) **System Reports** - Simplify requirement to address new system usage by medical staff
Initially, several system reports were outlined in the requirements ascertained from stakeholders; however, to ensure appropriate and consistent system usage, stakeholders have agreed to begin with system usage reporting before proceeding with more complex reporting.
2) **Tabbed or Accordion View for Patient Medical Record Interface**
Given the non-definitive aesthetic preference for either design option, the development team will proceed with the most user-friendly and pragmatic design option. To make the final decision, the development team will implement both designs and then make the aesthetic selection for the interface.
